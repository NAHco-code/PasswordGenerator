# Password Generator

## Description

Application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they've selected. Useful for employees with sensitive data; as this creates a strong password, providing greater security.

## Features

This page provides window prompts directing user to select required criteria for application to generate a secure password. If requirements are not met, application prompts user to select required criteria and try again.

## Roadmap

Future updates will include: a more asthetically pleasing experience; the ability to copy generated password to clipboard; and an edit in funtionality of a 'select criteria' vs the 'generate password' button. Users should be able to select criteria and generate mulitple passwords without running through prompts each time. The previously generated passwords should be visible, and listed below the textbox.

## Bug Fix

When a user doesn't select required criteria for a secure password to be generated, the text area should remain unchanged, rather than displaying 'undefined' text.
